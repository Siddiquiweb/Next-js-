SEO Friendly: With SSR and SSG, you can deliver pre-rendered pages to search engines, enhancing your site's visibility.
API Routes: You can create APIs directly within your Next.js app, eliminating the need for a separate backend service.

Getting Started with Next.js
Install Next.js with npx create-next-app@latest.
